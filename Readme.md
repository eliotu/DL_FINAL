# **Deep Learning Financial Covariance and Return Prediction**

This project aims to explore the correlation between assets and whether it can help to pre- dict asset returns.

## **Project Overview**

Financial predictions, such as stock returns and risk estimations, are crucial for informed decision-making in trading and portfolio management. This project aims to:

1. Predict **asset returns** for a 1-hour horizon.
2. Forecast the **covariance matrix** of asset returns for the same time period.

The project uses dual neural network (NN) architectures:

- **LSTM-based models** for covariance prediction.
- **Baseline models** like MLPs and StockMixer for return predictions.

By combining these models, the project assesses whether covariance insights can enhance return predictions.

## **Repository Structure**

- ### **Cholesky_Lstm/**

  - Implements an **LSTM model** to predict Cholesky decompositions of realized covariance matrices.
  - **Execution**:
    ```
    python Cholesky_Lstm/scripts/train_cholesky_model.py
    ```
    Users can select between two LSTM variants to test their performance.

- ### **Stock-Mixer_Model/**

  - Contains the **baseline model** for stock return predictions using MLP architectures.
  - **Execution**:
    ```
    python Stock_Mixer_Model/src/train.py
    ```

- ### **Combined_model/**

  - Integrates results from `Cholesky_Lstm` and `Stock-Mixer_Model` to create enhanced prediction architectures.
  - **StockMixer_cov_loaded/**:
    Stores covariance results from `Cholesky_Lstm` in a structured dataframe format.
  - Users can switch between `StockMixer_new1` and `StockMixer_new2` models to compare their performance.
  - **Execution**:
    Modify configurations as needed and execute corresponding scripts in the folder.
    ```
    python Combined_model/StockMixer_cov_loaded/src/train_with_covariance.py  
    ```
